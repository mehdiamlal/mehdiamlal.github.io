I am a second-year master's student at Sapienza University of Rome, and a research intern at GLADIA Research Lab and The Good AI Lab.

My current research activity is at the intersection of model merging, and domain adaptation, aiming to improve how deep learning models generalize without additional training. I also enjoy exploring other topics like computer vision or multimodal learning, and I get genuinely excited every time I come across an unfamiliar topic or a new project that offers a lot to learn.

When I am not reading papers or training models, I enjoy social activities like weekend trips with friends, movie nights or trying new restaurants.
